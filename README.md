# Movies Server

This Go application serves as a basic RESTful API for managing movie data. It allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on movie records using HTTP requests.

## Features

- List all movies
- Get a specific movie by ID
- Create a new movie record
- Update an existing movie record
- Delete a movie record

## Prerequisites

To run this server, you need to have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cyberguru1/GO-Movies-Server.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Go-Movies-Server
   ```
3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   The server will start on port 8000 by default.

## Usage
